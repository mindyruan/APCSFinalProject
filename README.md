================

Pacman (with a twist).

Small circles are extra points (not mandatory to clear all).
Once you get to the big circles, you have to clear a mini-game (probably snake).

Set amount of lives (3)
Lose a life when a ghost gets you.
Don't lose a life when you lose a mini game, but the length of the snake required is set higher.

(All the while, you're avoiding the ghosts.)

As you level...
- You have to clear more mini games.
- Ghosts get faster.

-Very basic movement for pacman using with keyboard input! (currently in one direction)
-Added continuous movements for up, down, left, right using w,a,s,d (circle goes a little offscreen when you go left or down)
-Fixed it so it doesn't go offscreen but encountered a problem; circle will only move along the edge when key is pressed, but if you get away from the edge, it goes back into continuous movement
