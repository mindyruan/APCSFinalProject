================

Pacman (with a twist).

Small circles are extra points (not mandatory to clear all).
Once you get to the big circles, you have to clear a mini-game (probably snake).

Set amount of lives (3)
Lose a life when a ghost gets you.
Don't lose a life when you lose a mini game, but the length of the snake required is set higher.

(All the while, you're avoiding the ghosts.)

As you level...
- You have to clear more mini games.
- Ghosts get faster.
